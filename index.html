                    <p class="blog-post-meta">January 2, 2017</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>These Twelve Steps, adapted nearly word-for-word from the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, have been a tool for spiritual growth for millions of Al‑Anon/Alateen members. At meetings, Al‑Anon/Alateen members share with each other the personal lessons they have learned from practicing from these Steps.</p>
                    <p>Al-Anon’s books and pamphlets have a great deal to say about how Al-Anon members use the three Legacies as a tool for spiritual growth. But the best way to come to understand the Legacies is to listen to members share at Al-Anon meetings.</p>
                    <h3>The Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
                        <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
                        <li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
                        <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
                        <li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
                        <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
                        <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
                        <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
                        <li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
                        <li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
                        <li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
                        <li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In Al-Anon/Alateen, members do not give direction or advice to other members. Instead, they share their personal experiences and stories, and invite other members to “take what they like and leave the rest”—that is, to determine for themselves what lesson they could apply to their own lives.</p>
